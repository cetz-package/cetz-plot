/// - labels (array): An array of either content or none, to be shown in the legend
///   for its corresponding series. The n'th y-keys series is labelled by the
///   n'th label (or none).
/// - label-key (string, int): The key at which the x-axis label is described in
///   each data entry.
/// - y-keys (array): The n'th entry in `y-keys` corresponds to the key at which 
///   the `y` coordinate can be found in each data entry, for the n'th series.
/// - y-error-keys (any): The n'th entry in `y-error-keys` corresponds to the key at 
///   which the `y-error` magnitude (as a float or as a tuple) can be found in
///   each data entry, for the n'th series.
/// - bar-width (float): The width of the bar along the `x` axis, in data-viewport
///   space. The bar is drawn centered about its `x` coordinate, therefore, the bar 
///   extends by $#raw("bar-width")\/2$ either side.
/// - bar-style (style): Style to use, can be used with a `palette` function
/// - axes (axes): Name of the axes to use for plotting. Reversing the axes

/// - ..plot-args (variadic): Additional plotting parameters and axis options to be
